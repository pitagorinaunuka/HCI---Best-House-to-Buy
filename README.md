# UI principles

<b> Content Awareness </b>
-ability of an interface to make the user aware of the information it contains with the least
amount of effort on the user’s part
-all areas should be clear and well defined (with titles if space permits) so that it is
difficult for the user to become confused about the information in any area

<b> Aesthetics </b>
-designing interfaces that are pleasing to the eye
-„less is more“
-all text should be in the same font and about the same size
-color and patterns should be used carefully and sparingly and only when they serve a
purpose
-goal is pleasant readability, not art

<b> User Experience </b>
-interfaces should be designed for both types of users (those with experience and those
without)
-novices, for example, often prefer menus that show all available system functions,
because these promote ease of learning
-experts, on the other hand, sometimes prefer fewer menus organized around the most
commonly used functions

<b> Consistency </b>
-users can interact with one part of the system and then know how to interact with the
rest
-consistency in the navigation controls (using the same icon or command to change an
item)
-consistency in terminology (using the same words for elements on forms and reports
(e.g., not customer in one place and client in another)

<b> Minimizing User Effort </b>
-using the fewest possible mouse clicks or keystrokes to move from one part of the
system to another
-three-clicks rule: Users should be able to go from the start or main menu of a system to
the information or action they want in no more than three mouse clicks or three
keystrokes

<b> Messages </b>
-messages should be clear and complete
-all messages should be grammatically correct and free of jargon and abbreviations
-avoid negatives because they can be confusing (e.g., replace Are you sure you do not
want to continue? with Do you want to quit?)

<b> Minimize keystrokes </b>
-a system should not require a user to type information that can be selected from a list;
selecting reduces errors and speeds entry
-the system should never ask for information that can be obtained in
another way (e.g., by retrieving it from a database or by performing a calculation)

<b> Input Validation </b>
-all data entered into the system need to be validated to ensure their accuracy
